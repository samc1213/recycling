<h2>What is this site for and who made it?</h2>
    <p><em>My Building Doesnâ€™t Recycle!</em> is a web app that allows renters to report that they do not have recycling in their building. This site was created by <a href='http://clairemicklin.com' target='_blank'>Claire Micklin</a>, <a href='http://benwilhelm.com' target='_blank'>Ben Wilhelm</a>, and <a href='https://github.com/alexkahn' target='_blank'>Alex Kahn</a> at <a href='http://opengovhacknight.org/' target='_blank'>Open Government Hack Night</a>.</p>

    <h2>What will you do with the data?</h2>
    <p>The data will help us to visualize reports of recycling noncompliance and provide a hub for residents of multi-unit buildings and other residents to have a collective voice in favor of more comprehensive recycling services.</p>
