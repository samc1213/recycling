Denver passed the [Waste No More initiative](https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Climate-Action-Sustainability-Resiliency/Zero-Waste/Waste-No-More) in November 2022, requiring large apartment buildings to provide recycling and compost services. However, the ordinance is not enforced.

There is a task force working on the enforcement of the new law. But this website can help gather info on which buildings are still lacking recycling/composting services.
